#+title: 3776. Minimum Moves to Balance Circular Array

* Problem Description
  You are given a circular array balance of length n, where balance[i] is the net balance of person i.

In one move, a person can transfer exactly 1 unit of balance to either their left or right neighbor.

Return the minimum number of moves required so that every person has a non-negative balance. If it is impossible, return -1.

Note: You are guaranteed that at most 1 index has a negative balance initially.

* Examples
  Example 1:

Input: balance = [5,1,-4]

Output: 4

Explanation:

One optimal sequence of moves is:

Move 1 unit from i = 1 to i = 2, resulting in balance = [5, 0, -3]
Move 1 unit from i = 0 to i = 2, resulting in balance = [4, 0, -2]
Move 1 unit from i = 0 to i = 2, resulting in balance = [3, 0, -1]
Move 1 unit from i = 0 to i = 2, resulting in balance = [2, 0, 0]
Thus, the minimum number of moves required is 4.

Example 2:

Input: balance = [1,2,-5,2]

Output: 6

Explanation:

One optimal sequence of moves is:

Move 1 unit from i = 1 to i = 2, resulting in balance = [1, 1, -4, 2]
Move 1 unit from i = 1 to i = 2, resulting in balance = [1, 0, -3, 2]
Move 1 unit from i = 3 to i = 2, resulting in balance = [1, 0, -2, 1]
Move 1 unit from i = 3 to i = 2, resulting in balance = [1, 0, -1, 0]
Move 1 unit from i = 0 to i = 1, resulting in balance = [0, 1, -1, 0]
Move 1 unit from i = 1 to i = 2, resulting in balance = [0, 0, 0, 0]
Thus, the minimum number of moves required is 6.​​​

Example 3:

Input: balance = [-3,2]

Output: -1

Explanation:

It is impossible to make all balances non-negative for balance = [-3, 2], so the answer is -1.
