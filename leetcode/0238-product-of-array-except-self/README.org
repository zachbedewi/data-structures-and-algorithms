#+title: 238. Product of Array Except Self

* Problem Description
  Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].
  The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
  You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

* Examples
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]

* Solutions

** S01. Prefix and Suffix Arrays

** S02. Space optimized prefix and suffix
